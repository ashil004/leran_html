            <p><b>Html: </b></br> The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. </br>
                It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</br>

                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.</br>
                 HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
                 <p>
                    <b>HTML TAG:</b></br>
                    HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references.</br> 
                    HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like h1 and h1, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. <br>
                   <b>The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</b>
            
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    <b>HTML DOCUMENTS:</b>
                    HTML documents are required to start with a Document Type Declaration (informally, a "doctype"). </br>
                    In browsers, the doctype helps to define the rendering modeâ€”particularly whether to use quirks mode.</br>

The original purpose of the doctype was to enable the parsing and validation of HTML documents by SGML tools based on the Document Type Definition (DTD).</br>
 The DTD to which the DOCTYPE refers contains a machine-readable grammar specifying the permitted and prohibited content for a document conforming to such a DTD. </br>
 Browsers, on the other hand, do not implement HTML as an application of SGML and as consequence do not read the DTD.</br>
